# Informal Consultation for Services / Some Thoughts
### Elijah Kennedy

Hey Cole! Here’s the context in which I wrote this document, for the sake of posterity:

On August 7th we had a phone conversation and you told me that you had a smaller-scale tobacco business-turned-hemp business which is pivoting into this new industry. My        understanding is that they are gearing up to produce smoke-able (and perhaps other…?)  CBD products that have .3% THC content or less as per FDA requirements. Along that     theme of FDA and general legal compliancy, you conveyed that they are serious about them taking regulations seriously and building what sounds like a positive, sustainable, and socially-productive business.

## Your Client’s Needs
If this is an incomplete list, please let me know. This is what I gathered from our phone call:

**Primary Needs**
1. E-commerce site that provides an easy shopping experience for a variety of products to normal consumers (retail)
1. Age Gateway to this website
1. A separate Catalogue only displayed to registered Wholesale customers
1. Appropriate fulfillment to distributors via email and/or other communication channels (Sms, Shopify Site, etc.)

**Secondary Needs**

1. Automated system for authenticating the legitimacy of Wholesale customers `*`

`*` Currently I can think of a bunch of ways to do this, I just don’t have a good idea about with how to integrate them with Shopify yet.

## Is Shopify the right tool to Use?
You have chosen Shopify as your tool of choice here. Shopify is a Content Management System (CMD) and more specifically an E-Commerce Platform. Shopify bundles up a gazillion features small-to-enormous-sized online businesses might use. Similar things I’ve heard of include Squarespace Marketplace and different implementation of the very popular Wordpress CMD. In fact, both of these are CMDs. However, while these are more general CMDs used to create websites that include the ability to add e-commerce functionality, Shopify is clearly built from the ground-up as a CMD designed with the specific intention of moving product, managing inventory, providing a good online shopping experience, and handling different forms of payment systems and even shipping and various other fulfillment. I’m still learning more about it to be honest, and didn’t know really anything before August 7th. In addition to all these features, it is not a black-box for developers – it was created by a Canadian Coding Wiz and has a lot of great offerings for developers. Although the “packages” Shopify customers can pick are varied, it seems to me as if it has about **4 basic products**.
</br>

1.	**The Baseline Shopify platform**, which you can use with know coding knowledge and an average level of interface intuition to configure a working and really quite nice e-commerce website and more
2.	**Shopify Apps** that mostly require a small monthly fee to use that allow you to, again with no coding, easily add special functionality on top of the baseline Shopify Platform.
3.	**Shopify Experts**, that is, accredited Shopify developers (and probably plenty who aren't) who can be hired to improve your baseline shopify Site.
4.	**Shopify Plus**, a big ol’ enterprise level service that adds a whole lot of extra functionality you might get from #1-3 for a whopping $2,000+ per month. If you are considering hiring a couple team of developers, $2k a month is probably cheaper, EXCEPT that developers actually build something that sticks around, whereas if you stop paying for Plus it just goes away.

My impression is that Shopify has done a good job if giving interested parties a lot of options at different price points. They seem to acknowledge that Shopify Plus might be good for, say, Toys R. Us, but probably not for your mom and pops store. I think that Shopify experts are worth checking out, especially to guarantee a shorter time to market. However, they can be pricey.

I’m not sure what your reasons are for settling on Shopify, but although I think it *is* a great pick, I would like to look around a bit more.

## Research/Thoughts on Achieving Your Client's Needs

A Shopify article on creating a “Members Only Store”. This article mentions a few options. They mention that there is actually a very direct way to do this, but it requires Shopify Plus (which, again, costs an ongoing $2000/month). They also mention hiring a Shopify expert, which doesn’t sound like a bad option when you consider that you could probably find someone who has done the exact same setup already. You just want to make sure that they write their code in such a way that further contractors wouldn’t have a problem making modifications if the needs for the website (invariable) change somewhere down the line.

They also mention the option of creating two separate Shopify stores. You may be able to tell me why this isn’t ideal, or maybe it even isn’t acceptable for some reason, but in my mind it actually has a lot of advantages that a single store would not.

One pro is that it simply allows for a very clear distinction between wholesale and retail. You can assess those two different sides of the business very separately without confusion. In addition, you can host them at related URLS, with the same visual style/branding, and with links passing easily passing people between them, so that they wouldn’t actually feel like separate sites because in reality they would not be. They would just be two separate Shopify stores.

Possibly best of all, this would be super easy, and fast. I already know how to do all of this. With this route, I can promise that we can make all of the deadlines you mentioned and focus on all of the configuration. It could buy time. Perhaps we do decide in the end that merging the Retail and Wholesale into a single site is in fact very important, then we at least have a working platform for the time being while that merging is worked on.

Lastly, maybe we don’t have the information to make the decision yet. If we implement the easiest option of two separate sites, everyone will be able to learn what is lacking so that when we really put the work in, we know exactly what is needed in the site and didn’t waste time or money to build a whole bunch of crazy functionality that actually wasn’t needed after all.

## My Rate

I feel comfortable working for **$12.50** an hour. While I hope that later on I will be directly building the needed features of your client’s site, I know from experience that, early on, technical is often less important than technical decisions. As such, I imagine my role starting out would mostly be characterized by the kind of research I have done in the past 24 hours, namely:

•	What tools are available (Shopify or otherwise)
•	How to use them
•	What specific configuration will achieve all of your client’s goals at the lowest cost and with the most sustainable Setup
•	Documenting this research clearly (like this) so that if if/when I leave these project, someone else can continue what I started
•	Communicating with you in a timely manner as progress is made developments appear

If necessary, I am willing to dedicate myself full time to this.

## Am I the Right Person for this Job?

I think it is very possible that we can reach your client’s goals without bringing in additional website expertise, but can’t quite promise that at this time.

What I *can* promise is that I will be an asset towards figuring out the way forward, and if at any point I find I am no longer able to contribute to the website goals of your client, I will step aside and help you find someone who can if you want. I have no desire to do work that is not helpful, or is questionably helpful. That’s bad for everyone.

That said, the goals outlined above are not too complex and I think I will be a powerful asset to making them happen for less money than a full-fledged web-dev veteran, and within the timeline proposed. A lot of that is possible because Shopify and tools like it really are quite customizable and easy to use, and that I have experience with similar technology such as Wordpress, Squarespace, CDN configurations, hosting, and more bare-bones web-dev.

You don't need to commit to a long timeline of hiring me as a contractor. If you decide at any point that I have done all I can do for you, or you want me to standby for a bit while you figure it out, just let me know, and I will stop recording billed hours.

## My Questions
1.	What is your Role in this project? You seem to be the lead point of contact, you are the main contractor, and you occasionally hire out work. Do you intend to/want to have a very active hand in the web development, or do you think your expertise is better suited for other parts of the project (you know, marketing, video, media, etc.).
2.	Very roughly, do you have any information on how many customers are forecasted to be buying through the site at various points in the timeline?
